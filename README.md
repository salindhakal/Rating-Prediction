The "Comprehensive Football Player Analysis and Prediction System Using Ensemble Algorithm" integrates various facets of player evaluation in football, leveraging advanced AI techniques. This project focuses on predicting player ratings using machine learning models based on detailed player attributes collected from the sofifa website by web scraping. The dataset includes attributes such as potential, crossing, finishing, heading accuracy, short passing, dribbling, and more. By synthesizing this data, the system can forecast future player ratings, which helps to identify promising talent, and provide insights into player development. The prediction models employ five Regression algorithms namely Linear model, Decision Tree model, Random Forest model, XGBOOST model, SVR model. A user-friendly web-based dashboard created using React.js presents visualizations, enhancing accessibility and usability. Through rigorous testing and validation, this project aims to furnish a powerful tool for football stakeholders, improving decision-making processes and fostering deeper insights into player dynamics.
